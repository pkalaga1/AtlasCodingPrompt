Extremely high transaction amount compared to average
- This is classic fraud, where all of a sudden you make a purchase that is far above what you normally spend / your average spend. This could be fraud because of someone stealing your card details and using them to make high value purchases that you dont normally make

Extremely large difference in time stamped activity, long time before another transaction
- This could be fraud because it could be account details of an inactive account. These are suspicious because they could have been found somewhere and started using the card after a long period of the owner of the account not using it.

Refund from merchant who they didnt purchase from
- This is possible refund fraud. Someone proved receipts or falsified receipts to get money from a merchant they never purchased from .

Constant Refunds, majority of transactions are refunded
- Another possible refund fraud where the buyer buys a bunch of products, but claims they returned them when they actually kept them.

High transaction volume to same merchant in short time frame
- This one isnt as fraudulent, but the idea is that some one was charged a bunch for a single merchant in a small time frame of the same amount. This could become a disputed transaction because the user was charged multiple times for the same transaction.
